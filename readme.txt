== Description ==

We've created an intuitive interface that looks just like WordPress itself. It's easy to learn, so you'll be building beautiful, responsive content in no time.

[vimeo https://vimeo.com/114529361]

Page Builder works with standard WordPress widgets, so you'll always find the widget you need. We've created the [SiteOrigin Widgets Bundle](https://wordpress.org/plugins/so-widgets-bundle/) to give you all the most common widgets, and with a world of plugins out there, you'll always find the widget you need.

= Ready to Be Used Anywhere =

Choose your editor; Page Builder is ready to be used anywhere. Build in the traditional Page Builder interface or insert a Page Builder Layout into the Block Editor. Insert the SiteOrigin Layout Widget into sidebar and footer widget areas or use the SiteOrigin Layout Block in block-based widget areas.

= It Works With Your Theme =

Page Builder gives you complete freedom to choose any WordPress theme you like. It's not a commitment to a single theme or theme developer. The advantage is that you're free to change themes as often as you like. Your content will always come along with you.

We've also made some fantastic [free themes](https://siteorigin.com/theme/) that work well with Page Builder.

= No Coding Required =

Page Builder's simple drag and drop interface means you'll never need to write a single line of code. Page Builder generates all the highly efficient code for you.

= Live Editing =

Page Builder supports live editing. This tool lets you see your content and edit widgets in real time. It's the fastest way to adjust your content quickly and easily.

= History Browser =

This tool lets you roll forward and back through your changes. It gives you the freedom to experiment with different layouts and content without the fear of breaking your content.

= Row, Cell, and Widget Styles =

Row, cell, and widget styles give you all the control you need to make your content uniquely your own. Change attributes like paddings, background colors, and column spacing. You can also enter custom CSS and CSS classes if you need even finer-grained control.

= Focussed on Performance =

We've built a lightweight framework, focusing on small page sizes and fast load time. Page Builder is compatible with [Autoptimize](https://wordpress.org/plugins/autoptimize/) and all other major performance plugins.

= SEO Optimized =

Page Builder uses modern SEO best practices and seamlessly integrates with all major SEO plugins, including Yoast SEO and Rank Math.

= It's Free, and Always Will Be =

Page Builder is our commitment to the democratization of content creation. Like WordPress, Page Builder is, and always will be, free. We'll continue supporting and developing it for many years to come. It'll only get better from here.

= Accessibility Ready =

Page Builder is accessibility-ready. Tab through all form fields and settings, and make changes without a mouse.

= Actively Developed =

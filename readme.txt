Build responsive page layouts using the widgets you know and love using this simple drag and drop page builder.

== Description ==

SiteOrigin Page Builder is a powerful content creation interface, instantly recognizable, astonishingly different. SiteOrigin Page Builder makes it easy to create responsive column-based content using the widgets you know and love. Your content will accurately adapt to all mobile devices, ensuring your site is mobile-ready. Read more on [SiteOrigin](https://siteorigin.com/page-builder/).

We've created an intuitive interface that looks just like WordPress itself. It's easy to learn, so you'll be building beautiful, responsive content in no time.

[vimeo https://vimeo.com/114529361]

Page Builder works with standard WordPress widgets, so you'll always find the widget you need. We've created the [SiteOrigin Widgets Bundle](https://wordpress.org/plugins/so-widgets-bundle/) to give you all the most common widgets, and with a world of plugins out there, you'll always find the widget you need.

= It Works With Your Theme =

Page Builder gives you complete freedom to choose any WordPress theme you like. It's not a commitment to a single theme or theme developer. The advantage is that you're free to change themes as often as you like. Your content will always come along with you.

We've also made some fantastic [free themes](https://siteorigin.com/theme/) that work well with Page Builder.

= No Coding Required =

Page Builder's simple drag and drop interface means you'll never need to write a single line of code. Page Builder generates all the highly efficient code for you.

We don't limit you with a set of pre-defined row layouts. Page Builder gives you complete flexibility. You can choose the exact number of columns for each row and the precise weight of each column - down to the decimal point. This flexibility is all possible using our convenient row builder. And, if you're not sure what you like, the Row Builder will guide you towards beautifully proportioned content using advanced ratios.

= Live Editing =

Page Builder supports live editing. This tool lets you see your content and edit widgets in real-time. It's the fastest way to adjust your content quickly and easily.

= History Browser =

This tool lets you roll forward and back through your changes. It gives you the freedom to experiment with different layouts and content without the fear of breaking your content.

= Row and Widget Styles =

Row and widget styles give you all the control you need to make your content uniquely your own. Change attributes like paddings, background colors, and column spacing. You can also enter custom CSS and CSS classes if you need even finer-grained control.

= It's Free, and Always Will Be =

Page Builder is our commitment to the democratization of content creation. Like WordPress, Page Builder is, and always will be free. We'll continue supporting and developing it for many years to come. It'll only get better from here.

We offer free support on the [SiteOrigin support forums](https://siteorigin.com/thread/).

= Actively Developed =

Page Builder is actively developed with new features and exciting enhancements all the time. Keep track on the [Page Builder GitHub repository](https://github.com/siteorigin/siteorigin-panels).

Read the [Page Builder developer docs](https://siteorigin.com/docs/page-builder/) if you'd like to develop for Page Builder.

= Available In 32 Languages =

Through the efforts of both professional translators and our community, Page Builder is available in the following languages: Afrikaans, Bulgarian, Chinese (China), Chinese (Taiwan), Croatian, Czech, Danish, Dutch, Dutch (Belgium), English (Australia), English (Canada), English (New Zealand), English (UK), English (US), Finnish, French (France), Galician, Georgian, German, Hebrew, Italian, Japanese, Portuguese (Brazil), Portuguese (Portugal), Romanian, Russian, Spanish (Colombia), Spanish (Spain), Spanish (Venezuela), Swedish, Turkish, and Ukrainian.

= Accessibility Ready =

Page Builder is accessibility ready. Tab through all form fields and settings, make changes without using a mouse.

== Installation ==

1. Upload and install Page Builder in the same way you'd install any other plugin.
2. Read the [usage documentation](http://siteorigin.com/page-builder/documentation/) on SiteOrigin.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= How do I move a site created with Page Builder from one server to another? =

We recommend the [Duplicator Plugin](https://wordpress.org/plugins/duplicator/). We've tested it in several instances, and it always works well with Page Builder data.

= Can I bundle Page Builder with my theme? =

Yes, provided your theme is licensed under GPL or a compatible license. If you're publishing your theme on ThemeForest, you must select the GPL license instead of their regular license.

Page Builder is actively developed and updated, so generally; we recommend that you have your users install the original plugin so they can receive updates. You can try [TGM Plugin Activation](http://tgmpluginactivation.com/).

= Will plugin X work with Page Builder? =

We've tried to ensure that Page Builder is compatible with most plugin widgets. It's best to download Page Builder and test for yourself.

== SiteOrigin Premium ==

[SiteOrigin Premium](https://siteorigin.com/downloads/premium/) enhances Page Builder with a vast array of additional features and settings. Take your layouts to the next level with SiteOrigin Premium addons.

SiteOrigin Premium includes access to our professional email support service, perfect for those times when you need fast and effective technical support. We're standing by to assist you in any way we can.
